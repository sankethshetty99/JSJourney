JS creates execution contexts, withing execution contexts
that store variables in mem + execution code
1st phase mem creation mem 
2nd phase running code in execution code

variables = undefined
functions = whole code
This has implications with hoisting.
arrow functions are variables = undefined

The call stack - is the stack of execution contexts.

---
In the global context,
this = window
any var can be accessed as this.x instead of x
---
lexical scope
top of call stack has access to variables in the bottom of call stack. so that entire area that it has access to is called lexical scope.

---
let const and var have different hoisting rules
let variables go into temporal dead zone, variable is hoisted not in the global scope but, in a separate zone , giving us a ref err if u try to access before initialization
with let, you have to initialise, to be able to access it.
if u try to access - reference error. let variables are not attached to the global scope.

trying to redeclare a let - syntax err
trying to redeclare a const - type err

-------
closure

a function bundled with its lexical scope .
usecases:
- module design pattern
- currying
- functions like once
- memoize
- maintaining state in aync world
- setTimeouts
- iterators
- and many more..


-------
Javascript Runtime environment
=
JS engine (v8)
+
Event loop (actually a runtime concept, not engine concept)
+
Callback queue(task queue)
+
Microtask queue (higher priority)
(promises and document mutations)
+
native APIs


Example of JS runtime environment
= nodeJS / Broswer

both have all of those things.

Example of APIs
- setTimeouts
- DOM APIs (on Browser)
- fetch
- console

so different environments expose diff APIs
setTimeout (same name for both browser and nodeJS), but are completely different implementations underneath. (same behavior)

------------
JS engine
= 
Call stack. (stack of execution contexts)
+
Parser of code creates AST(abstract syntax tree)
+ 
JIT compilation, which means
Interpreter(knows to run the run line by line)
+ Compiler (keeps optimising parts of the code in the background) for the interpreter to be able to execute the bytecode even faster next time.
+ 
Actual execution of the code
+
Garbage collector
+
Memory heap
